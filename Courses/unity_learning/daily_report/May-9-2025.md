### **Objective:**

Complete the foundational mechanics for the **Space Trash Shooter** game in Unity, including player movement and shooting mechanics.

---

### ‚úÖ **Activities Completed:**

1. **Player Movement Implementation:**
    - Created the **PlayerController** script and attached it to the Player GameObject.
    - Implemented left and right movement using `Input.GetAxis("Horizontal")`.
    - Applied frame-rate independent movement using `Time.deltaTime`.
    - Clamped the player‚Äôs position to prevent it from flying off-screen based on the camera‚Äôs size and aspect ratio.
2. **Shooting Mechanics Implementation:**
    - Created a **Bullet Prefab** with:
        - A simple bullet sprite.
        - `Rigidbody2D` with **Gravity Scale set to 0**.
        - `BoxCollider2D` for collision detection.
    - Defined a **BulletSpawnPoint** above the player to control where bullets originate.
    - Developed the **PlayerShooting** script to handle firing logic:
        - Detecting input (Spacebar or left mouse click).
        - Instantiating bullets at the spawn point.
        - Applying velocity or force to bullets for upward movement.
        - Implementing a fire rate to prevent bullet spamming.

### üî• **Key Takeaways and Learnings:**

- Implementing player movement requires careful handling of frame rate with `Time.deltaTime`.
- Clamping positions ensures objects stay within the visible screen area and prevents unexpected gameplay issues.
- Modularizing the shooting logic using a separate spawn point and prefab allows for easy modification and future extensions (e.g., power-ups, multiple bullet types).
- Debugging player input and projectile instantiation reinforces understanding of Unity‚Äôs frame-based execution and object pooling concepts.

---

### üìç **Next Steps:**

- Implement enemy/trash spawning mechanics with randomized positions and falling speeds.
- Detect collisions between bullets and trash objects and handle destruction.
- Add a basic scoring system to reward the player for hitting targets.
- Consider simple animations or effects to make the shooting more satisfying.
