### **Objective:**

Enhance the **Space Trash Shooter** game by implementing shooting mechanics, sound effects, visual explosion effects, and collision detection between bullets and enemies.

---

### ‚úÖ **Activities Completed:**

1. **Shooting Mechanic Implementation:**
    - Developed the `EnemyGenerator.cs` script to  spawn new enemies.
2. **Collision Detection Implementation:**
    - Developed the `BulletCollision.cs` script to handle collisions between bullets and enemies.
    - Configured the Bullet Prefab with a BoxCollider2D set as a **Trigger** and a Rigidbody2D set to **Dynamic** with zero gravity.
    - Configured the Enemy Prefab with a BoxCollider2D and Rigidbody2D to detect collisions.
    - Implemented the collision logic to destroy both the bullet and enemy upon contact.
    - Debugged collision issues related to missing Rigidbody2D components and incorrect trigger settings.
    
    **Key Note:** Use `OnTriggerEnter2D()` for trigger-based collision detection. 
    
    - for the trigger, one(bullet) object‚Äôs isTrigger propertyshould be true. for the other one (enemy) this property should be false.
    
    ```csharp
    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision) { ... }
    ```
    
3. **Sound Effects Integration:**
    - Added shooting sound effects to the player‚Äôs shooting action.
    - Implemented an explosion sound effect for enemy hits within the `BulletCollision.cs` script.
    - Utilized `AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint()` to play audio at the collision point.
    - Adjusted audio playback logic to prevent multiple overlapping sounds.
    - 
    
    **Key Note:** Play audio at specific positions using `AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint()`.
    
    - We need to add a `AudioSource` component
    - Then get a `AudioClip` as a SerializeField
    - Then using the `AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint` play the `AudioClip`
    
    ```csharp
    AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint(explosionSound, transform.position);
    ```
    
4. **Visual Effects Integration:**
    - Developed a simple explosion effect using a particle system.
    - Created and configured an `explosionEffect` prefab with adjustable particle settings (size, speed, lifetime).
    - Implemented the effect instantiation logic within the collision script, ensuring the effect is properly oriented upon spawning.
    - Debugged visibility issues by adjusting X-axis positioning and correcting rotation using `Quaternion.Euler()`.
    
    **Key Note:** Adjust rotation upon instantiation to correct orientation.
    
    - In order to show the effect properly we should rotate it around X-axis
    
    ```csharp
    Quaternion effectRotation = Quaternion.Euler(-90, 0, 0);
    ```

### üî• **Key Learnings and Takeaways:**

- Properly configuring Rigidbody2D and Collider2D components is crucial for consistent collision detection.
- Ensuring that prefab references are correctly assigned in the Inspector is critical to prevent null reference errors.
- Adjusting X-axis values and rotation angles can significantly impact the visibility and orientation of visual effects.
- Utilizing `AudioSource.PlayClipAtPoint()` provides a simple method for positional audio without requiring an AudioSource component on every instantiated object.

### üìç **Next Steps:**

- Implement a scoring system to reward the player for successfully hitting enemies.
- Display the current score using Unity UI elements.
- Adjust enemy spawn rates and bullet speed to balance gameplay difficulty.
- Consider adding background music and additional sound effects to further enhance game feedback and atmosphere.
