# Daily Progress Report — May 26, 2025

## 🎯 What I Implemented Today

---

### ✅ 1. Accuracy Tracking Logic

- Tracked bullets shot and enemies destroyed through GameManager stats.
- Calculated accuracy percentage with:

```csharp
(float)destroyed_enemies / shooted_bullets * 100f
```

- Displayed accuracy in real-time using TextMeshPro UI.

---

### ✅ 2. Game Over Logic

- Triggered game over when the player collided with an enemy using collision detection.
- Example logic:

```csharp
if (collision.CompareTag("Player")){    GameOverManager.Instance.TriggerGameOver();}
```

- Inside `TriggerGameOver()`:
    - Set `Time.timeScale = 0` to pause the game.
    - Enabled the Game Over panel.

---

### ✅ 3. Game Over UI

- Created a UI panel in Canvas with TextMeshPro components.
- UI Elements:
    - “Game Over” Text
    - “Restart” Button
- Made the panel inactive by default.
- Showed the panel on game over.
- Hooked the restart button to:

```csharp
SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex);
```

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- How to calculate and display accuracy using gameplay stats.
- How to detect collision between enemy and player.
- How to pause the game using `Time.timeScale`.
- How to control UI visibility through scripting.
- How to reload scenes and reset game state.

---

## 📍 Next Steps (Suggestions)

- Display score and accuracy summary in the Game Over UI.
- Add background music and game over sound.
- Implement difficulty scaling (e.g., faster enemies).
- Add a main menu or level select system.
